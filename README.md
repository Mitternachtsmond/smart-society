# Simply Home - Society Management System

### Tech Stacks
1. React
2. CSS
3. MySQL
4. Django

### Motivation
Housing Societies consist of massive manual work. The documentation of this work is neither correct nor transparent to other residents, often causing unusual struggles among the residents.
Housing Societies rarely use websites that could reduce their work and bring automation. This occasional use may be because of the lack of such websites. Therefore, we wanted to make a website that can reduce their work, bring about automation, transparency, and proper documentation.

We also wanted an innovative project with a robust and unique selling proposition with an extensive database, which will prove an asset to our knowledge and our resume.

Hence, the Society Management System seemed to be the best choice.

### FAQs
Why this Tech Stack?
We wanted to expand our tech stack and explore different frameworks to differentiate amongst them and use them according to our needs in the future.
